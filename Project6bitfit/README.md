# Android Project 6 - *Bitfit*

Submitted by: **Agraw Mindaye**

**Bitfit** is a health metrics app that allows users to track their calories. 
Users will be able to enter details regarding the food and the number of calories it contains. 
In addition to seeing their past entries, users can see a summary of their entries,
including the average, maximum, and minimum record of their entries.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Use at least 2 Fragments**
- [x] **Create a new dashboard fragment where users can see a summary of their entered data**
- [x] **Use one of the Navigation UI Views (BottomNavigation, Drawer Layout, Top Bar) to move between the fragments**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

The project was very similar to the last one, 
it just included fragmentation and bottom navigation so 
there weren't really any difficulties
