**Tap Counter App** is an Android app inspired by idle tap games, allowing users to accumulate points through taps, which can be exchanged for upgrades.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total <!-- Replace 'X' with the number of hours you spent on this project -->

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **User can see a number displayed on the screen. The number starts at 0.**
    - ![Image/GIF showing the initial display of the number](http://i.imgur.com/link/to/your/gif/file.gif) <!-- Replace this link with your actual image/GIF link -->

- [x] **User can tap on a button to see the number displayed increase by 1.**

    - <img src='doubleTap.gif' title='Video Walkthrough' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough' />

- [x] User can customize the app's theme (e.g., using a dog background and a paw print button).
  - <img src='customIcon.gif' title='Video Walkthrough' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough' />

- [ ] User has progressively difficult goals to reach in terms of number of taps accumulated.

## Notes

The app was simple, it was mostly the new environment that made the assignment somewhat challenging. 
Learning how to customize buttons and images and using Kotlin for the first time brought a bit of 
a steep learning curve, but besides that it was an enjoyable lab.
