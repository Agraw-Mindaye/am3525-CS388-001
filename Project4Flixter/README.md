Submitted by: **Agraw Mindaye**

**Name of your app** is a movie browsing app that allows users to browse popular
movies using The Movie Database API API. Each movie is shown with its poster and title. When
clicked, users can see more details, including a description, release date, and rating.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Choose any endpoint on The MovieDB API except `now_playing`**
    - Chosen Endpoint: `popular`
- [x] **Make a request to your chosen endpoint and implement a RecyclerView to display all entries**
- [x] **Use Glide to load and display at least one image per entry**
- [x] **Click on an entry to view specific details about that entry using Intents**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [] **Add another API call and RecyclerView that lets the user interact with different data.**
- [] **Add rounded corners to the images using the Glide transformations**
- [] **Implement a shared element transition when user clicks into the details of a movie**
