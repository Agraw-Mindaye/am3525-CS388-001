# Android Project 5 - *Bitfit-part1*

Submitted by: **Agraw Mindaye**

**Bitfit** is a health metrics app that allows users to their calories. Users will be able to enter details
regarding the food and the number of calories it contains. They will also be able to see their past entries,
giving them a timeline of their food intake.

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **At least one health metric is tracked (based on user input)**
    - Chosen metric(s): `[calories]`
- [x] **There is a "create entry" UI that prompts users to make their daily entry**
- [x] **New entries are saved in a database and then updated in the RecyclerView**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [] **Create a UI for tracking averages and trends in metrics**
- [] **Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring**

## Notes

The app is straightforward, but working with Room and databases was 
a bit of a steep learning curve. Additionally the app kept crashing when 
being built so debugging was also difficult. Overall, it was a fun project.
